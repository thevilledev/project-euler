# What is Project Euler?

A quote from their [website](https://projecteuler.net/):

> Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

# What is this repository?

This repository contains my solutions for Project Euler problems. For now
I have only used Python and C++.

# But you will spoil the answers!

Then why are you here? :-)
